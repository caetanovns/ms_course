# ms_course - Microservices with Java and Spring Boot

## Overview

This repository, "ms_course," contains code and resources developed as part of a course on building microservices using Java and Spring Boot. Microservices architecture is a design approach for building scalable and maintainable applications by breaking them down into smaller, independent services.

The code and examples provided here serve as a practical guide for understanding and implementing microservices-based applications with Java and Spring Boot.
